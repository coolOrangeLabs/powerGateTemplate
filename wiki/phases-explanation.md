# Introduction

We split the powerGate Projects into multiple phases this ensures that:
+ We control the project 
+ We have different milestones 
+ Set specific expectations for the customer and us

## Explanation

Each phase is defined as a Github Project:
+ Every one includes an "Overview" issue which shows the current progress _([Example](https://github.com/coolOrangeLabs/powerGateTemplate/issues/112))_

### Before the project is ordered

coolOrange _Project Team_ joins with the _Sales Team_ the customer meeting where he shows the current workflow:
 + In order to make a better solution purpose and a more accurate estimation

### When the project is ordered

Then the project starts with the [[Initialisation phase|Initialisation-Phase]].
