If coolOrange released a new version for you and you donÂ´t knot how and where to install the customizations, here you get some help.

Some information about the installer:
* The installer overrides all files from an older version and leaves newer files unchanged. So if you want to install an older version then already installed or you just want to be sure you have the latest setup, please uninstall the current.

Normally coolOrange releases three customizations-installer, when a new version is ready:
-	**ErpServices_Client_1.x.x_xxx.msi:** All steps to set up your workstations (Clients) with the coolOrange programs and customizations: [[Client-Installation|Client-Installation]]
-	**ErpServices_Jobs_1.x.x_xxx.msi:** All steps to take on the machine where the Vault Job processor is installed: [[Jobs-Installation|Jobs-Installation]]
-	**ErpServices_Plugin_1.x.x_xxx.msi:** All steps to take on the machine where the Vault server is running: [[Server-Installation|Plugin Installation]] (most of our customers install powerGate Server on the same machine where the Vault server is running)
