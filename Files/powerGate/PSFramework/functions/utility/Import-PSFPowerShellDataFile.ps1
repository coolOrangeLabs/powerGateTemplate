	.SYNOPSIS
		A wrapper command around Import-PowerShellDataFile
	
	.DESCRIPTION
		A wrapper command around Import-PowerShellDataFile
		This enables use of the command on PowerShell 3+ as well as during JEA endpoints.
	
		Note: The protective value of Import-PowerShellDataFile is only offered when run on PS5+.
		This is merely meant to provide compatibility in the scenarios, where the original command would fail!
		If you care about PowerShell security, update to the latest version (in which case this command is still as secure as the default command, as that is what will actually be run.
	
	.PARAMETER Path
		The path from which to load the data file.
	
	.PARAMETER LiteralPath
		The path from which to load the data file.
		In opposite to the Path parameter, input here will not be interpreted.
